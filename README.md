# Party mode

### Attention
**If you are in Russia or in any country with banned cloudflare use any kind of bypass services like vpn or zapret if you want to use our free server**

By default party mode connects to remote server "mrekk.ru"
Source code of this server you can find [here](https://github.com/saQult/KoolChangerLobby)

You can host your own remote server, make some changes [here](https://github.com/saQult/koolchanger/blob/main/CSLOLTool/Services/LobbyService.cs#L10) and build app

> How party mode works?

First of all, it completly removes all of your selected skins (after disabling it comes back your selected skins)

1. Enable party mode
2. Join lobby in league if you are not in lobby
3. KoolChanger parses lobby data throught [LCU api](https://github.com/bryanhitc/lcu-sharp)
4. When you are in league lobby, KoolChanger checks if someone already created lobby with UUID of any lobby members, if not, it creates lobby hub in remote server
5. When someone joins, all other players send their skins to joined player
6. If someone select any skin, this skin sends to another lobby members
   
   
Use party mode if you trust your friends because they can make u play with some ugly skin XD

## How this works
Basicaly, it uses [cslolmanager tool](https://github.com/LeagueToolkit/cslol-manager/tree/master/cslol-tools) cli to install and load .fantome files from [dark seal's repository](https://github.com/darkseal-org/lol-skins-developer)
